Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

To predictÂ the presence of cardiac disease in a patient, we have used a number of Machine Learning algorithms that were developed in Python. This classification issue predicts whether or not heart disease is present by using a range of characteristics as input features and a binary variable as the target variable.

Machine Learning algorithms used here are:

Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)  
Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)  
Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)  
K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)  
Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)  
Random Forest (Scikit-learn)  

Accuracy achieved: 95% (Random Forest)
